        <h3>Self Checkout Machines: An Analysis of User Interactions</h3>
		<h4>Overview</h4>

	

		<p>In this project, we step into the user’s shoes.In this project,I observe real users interacting with an interface, interview these individuals about their experiences, create personas based on these users, and illustrate a storyboard for one of the personas.
		</p>
		

		<h4>Description</h4>
		<div class = 'img-container'>
			<img src ='images/machine.png'>
		</div>
		<p> 
			The self checkout machine is an alternative for customers who do not want to checkout their items over the counter, that is ,through a cashier.
			The system allows customers to save on time since they don’t have to wait on long queues to have their items checked out.
			<br>
			Once the customer is at the station, they immediately start scanning their items on the bar code scanner.
			The customer then goes ahead to press the “Finish and Pay” button on the touchscreen display.
			The customer then inserts their card or swipes it on the card machine, and opts in or out of a receipt.
		</p>
        
        <h4>Observation</h4>
		<p>
			I observed two of the customers go straight into scanning their items, clicking the ‘Finish and Pay’ button, inserting their cards into the card machine, and finally bagging their items.
			However, there seemed to be a lag during the payment process for both customers.
			<br>
			One of the customers fumbled for a while at the beginning before starting to scan their items.
			The customer had a hard time scanning some of the items in their basket and only succeeded after a few tries of continuously rotating the items over the barcode reader. 
			The customer had to wave down the cashier for help during the payment stage of the process. 
			Overall, it took the third customer a longer time to check out a smaller number of items compared to the other two customers.
			<br>
			The self-checkout process took longer than expected and consequently the  self checkout line was longer

		<h4>User Interviews</h4>
		<p>
		    <h6> 1.What motivated you to use the self-checkout system?</h6>
			<p>
				-All three users mentioned time efficiency as their main reason for opting for the self-checkout service. 
				User 3 added that they had few items to purchase and didn’t see the need to wait in line for the over-the-counter checkout.
				<br>
				-User 3 was also keen on minimizing human interaction since they had recently tested positive for covid and wanted to keep other people around them safe.
			
			</p>
		
            <h6>2.On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate your experience with the self-checkout machine(1 being very bad and 10 being very good)?</h6>
			<p>
				-User 1 rated their experience at  7
				<br>
				-User 2 rated their experience at 8
				<br>
				-User 3 rated their experience at 3
			</p>

			<h6>3.What is your favorite aspect/feature of the self-checkout machine?</h6>
		    <p>
			-All the users cited the clear instructions on the screen and the automated voice instructions as helpful.
			<br>
			-The users also found the beep after each scan to be very helpful in letting them know if and when a scan was successful.
			</p>
			<h6>4.Did you experience any challenges while using the machine? If yes, what are these challenges?</h6>
			<p>
			-All three users mentioned being confused after clicking the ‘Finish and pay’ button”.Clicking the button automatically activates the card machine and does not prompt the users to select a mode of payment. 
			There is no clear sign to alert the user that the card machine is ready, which resulted in confusion on whether or not to insert their cards into the machine.
			<br>
			-User 3 cited using the machine for the first time, and found the instructions very clear, but mentioned that further gestures on the machine and not just instructions on the main screen would help make the process more intuitive.
			This user had trouble scanning their products because they were not sure how to display the bar codes to be read.
			</p>
			
			<h6>5.Would you like to share any other comments about your experience with the machine, or suggestions to improve user experience?</h6>
			<p>
			-Users 1 and 2 mentioned not knowing what to do when they got stuck in the payment process, as they felt that the ‘Request Help’ button was tied to the previous step, that is, item scanning, and would therefore not be resourceful in the payment stage.
			<br>
			-User 3 noted that it would be beneficial to have a ‘Start’ button, that would assure them that the machine is ready for a new check-out process.
			<br>
			-User 3 mentioned that having trouble-shooting instructions with clear visuals as an option when one clicks the ‘Request Help’ button would have made their experience much better, by helping them minimize human interaction.
			<br>
			-All three users suggested that the card machine display a clear message showing it is ready to for use, for instance, a sound or flashing lights.

		<h4>Empathy Maps</h4>

		<h4>Storyboard</h4>
		<div class="img-container">
			<img src="images/board.png" width="100%" height='100%'>
		</div>
		
		<h4>Conclusion</h4>
		<p>
			This activity allowed me to step into the user’s shoes and gauge their feelings and consequent experience with the self-checkout machine.
			The empathy map was valuable in terms of allowing me to think about the user and how best the interface could be modeled to best serve them.
			<br>
			It was clear that the customers that had a better experience were not first-time users and had therefore formed an intuitive approach to checking out. 
			First-time users on the other hand had a harder time and would therefore need more instructions on how to move around the self-checkout machine. 
			<br>
			In the end, the machine was not as fast as its users would have wanted it to be given the confusion around when to make card payments.
